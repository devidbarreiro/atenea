{Describe the scene in plain language with specific, concrete visual details. Include characters, costumes, scenery, weather, and setting. Use precise descriptions (e.g., "wet asphalt, zebra crosswalk, neon signs reflecting in puddles" instead of vague terms). Anchor your subject with distinctive details to keep it recognizable.}

Cinematography:
Camera shot: {framing and angle, e.g., wide establishing shot at eye level, medium close-up with low angle, aerial wide shot with slight downward angle}
Lighting: {lighting description with color palette anchors, e.g., warm key from overhead practical with cool spill, golden natural key with tungsten bounce. Include 3-5 color anchors for consistency}
Mood: {overall tone, e.g., cinematic and tense, playful and suspenseful, nostalgic and tender, gentle and whimsical}

Actions:

- {Action 1: Clear, specific beat described in precise timing and counts, e.g., "Actor takes four steps to the window, pauses, and pulls the curtain in the final second"}
- {Action 2: Another distinct beat within the clip with specific timing}

{Dialogue:}

{If the shot has dialogue, place it in a clear block. Keep lines brief and natural to match clip length. For multi-character scenes, label speakers consistently:

- Character 1: "First line"
- Character 2: "Response"}

{Background Sound:}
{If relevant, describe diegetic sounds that enhance the scene, e.g., "Rain, ticking clock, soft mechanical hum" or "Natural ambience: faint wind, fabric flutter, street noise"}
