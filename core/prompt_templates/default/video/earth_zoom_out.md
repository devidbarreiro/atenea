CINEMATIC ONE-SHOT. An **EXTREME LONG TAKE** with smooth, continuous, and accelerating camera motion. No cuts, no stuttering. The entire sequence is captured in a **single, fluid shot**. **START:** A **{person: man/woman/person, early 40s / age, ethnicity if desired, neutral expression or specific expression}**, stands confidently at the highest point of a **{location: lush green hilltop at dawn / deserted gas station at golden hour / vibrant flower field / neon-lit urban night street / retro motel in the desert / specific location}**. {person} wears **{outfit: bright white rain jacket with the hood cinched tightly, classic blue denim jeans, and white sneakers / detailed outfit description}**. The location is **{atmosphere: wind-swept and moody / dramatic / serene / vibrant}**, with a thick **volumetric mist/cinematic haze** rolling across {surroundings: the grass behind them / the landscape / the environment}. **AESTHETICS (Initial):** Shot on **ARRI ALEXA 65**, Ultra Photo-realistic, **10K fidelity**. Dramatic **low-angle close-up** shot, intense eye contact with the camera. **COMPLEX MOVEMENT PHASE 1 (Angle Transition):** The camera executes a **slow, seamless, continuous crane shot** that **rises directly and smoothly up and over the subject**, transitioning the perspective from the initial low-angle frontal view to a **perfect 90-degree high-angle (top-down / bird's-eye view)**. This movement reveals the person's head and the immediate surrounding {surroundings: grass / environment}. **MOVEMENT PHASE 2 (Earth Zoom-Out):** Without stopping, the camera performs an **ULTRA-FAST, ACCELERATING CONTINUOUS ZOOM-OUT** from the high-angle perspective. The movement is a flawless, escalating dolly zoom that pulls back, revealing the full {location type: hilltop / location}, the vast rolling landscape below, the entire region, continent, and rapidly exiting the cloud cover into space.
