A {detailed description of a stylish young man/woman/person, age, ethnicity if desired, hair, outfit, accessories, sunglasses} stands confidently in {specific location and atmosphere, e.g. deserted gas station at golden hour / vibrant flower field / neon-lit urban night street / retro motel in the desert}. Dramatic lighting, low-angle close-up shot looking slightly up, emphasizing their powerful presence and bold expression. They remain completely still and stare directly into the camera. Suddenly the camera performs a fast, smooth, and continuous zoom-out: first revealing the immediate surroundings, then the full landscape, mountains/desert/city, the entire region, continent, atmosphere, and keeps pulling back into the darkness of space. Final frame shows a single, clean, photorealistic Earth slowly rotating in the void of space, no duplicates, no overlays, no text, no graphics. A subtle soft glowing dot marks the exact original location of the person on the planet.
